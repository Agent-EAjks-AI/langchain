# LangChain v0.4

*Last updated: 08.06.25*

## What's changed

New message types have been added to a `v1` namespace in `langchain-core`. Select
integration packages now also expose a `v1` namespace containing chat models that
work with the new message types.

Input types for callbacks and output parsers have been widened to accept the new message
types. Type checkers may raise errors for custom callbacks and output parsers that do
not conform to the new interface. This is the only breaking change.
