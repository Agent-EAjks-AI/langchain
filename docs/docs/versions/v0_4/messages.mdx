# LangChain v1.0 message types

*Last updated: 08.08.25*

LangChain v0.4 allows developers to opt-in to new message types that will become default
in LangChain v1.0. LangChain v1.0 will be released this fall.

These messages should be considered a beta feature and are subject to change in
LangChain v1.0, although we do not anticipate any significant changes.

## Benefits

The new message types offer improvements in performance, type-safety, and consistency
across OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and other providers.

### Performance

Importantly, the new messages are Python dataclasses, saving some runtime from
instantiating (layers of) Pydantic BaseModels.

LangChain v0.4 introduces a new `BaseChatModel` class in `langchain_core.v1.chat_models`
that is faster and leaner than the existing `BaseChatModel` class, offering significant
reductions in overhead above provider SDKs.

### Type-safety

Message content is typed as
```python
import langchain_core.messages.content_blocks as types

content: list[types.ContentBlock]
```

where we have introduced standard types for text, reasoning, citations, server-side
tool executions (e.g., web search and code interpreters). These include
[tool calls](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/tool_calling/) and the
[multi-modal types](/docs/how_to/multimodal_inputs/) introduced in earlier versions
of LangChain. There are no breaking changes associated with the existing content types.

**This is the most significant change from the existing message classes**, which permit
strings, lists of strings, or lists of untyped dicts as content. We have added a
`.text` getter so that developers can easily recover string content. `.tool_calls`,
instead of an attribute, is now also a getter with an associated setter, so that
usage is largely the same. See [usage comparison](#usage-comparison), below, for details.

### Consistency

Many chat models can generate a variety of content in a single conversational turn,
including reasoning, tool calls and responses, images, text with citations, and other
structured objects. We have standardized these types, resulting in improved
inter-operability of messages across models.

## Usage comparison

| Task                    | Previous | New                                            |
|-------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------|
| Get string content      | `message.content`            | `message.text`             |
| Get content blocks      | `message.content`            | `message.content`          |
| Get `additional_kwargs` | `message.additional_kwargs`  | `[block for block in message.content if block["type"] == "..."]` |
| Get `response_metadata` | `message.response_metadata`  | `message.response_metadata`|
| Get `tool_calls`        | `message.tool_calls`         | `message.tool_calls`       |


## Feature gaps

The new message types do not yet support LangChain's caching layer. Support will be
added in the coming weeks.
